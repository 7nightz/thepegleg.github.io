  <h1>About Me - Sebastian92</h1>
  <p>Hey there, I'm Sebastian! My coding world revolves around <span class="username">c64 BASIC</span> and <span class="username">PenguinMod</span>.
    You'll usually find me under the username "<span class="username">cbass92</span>." Besides coding, I also have a great passion for reading, exploring different worlds and ideas through books.
    Currently, my focus is on a fascinating project called <span class="project">GRAYSCALE</span>, an I-frame browser within the <span class="username">PenguinMod</span> platform.
    I love diving into a bunch of other cool tech stuff as well. With all these interests, I'm thrilled about the creative possibilities ahead, and I can't wait to achieve even more exciting things in the future!</p>
